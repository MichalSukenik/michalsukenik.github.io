										<h2>Why I Enjoy 3D Modelling</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I really enjoy 3D modelling as I find it amazing to be able to create whatever I need for projects. In the first year of University I have found out that 
										I am definitely a hard-surface modeller however I struggle with organic modelling. Finding this out has really helped me focus more on what I enjoy most.</p>

												<h3>Hard-Surface Fortnite Tool</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This high poly fortnite tool is something I am currently making as a University project. I have used a large variety of modelling techniques in order to be able to complete this.
												<br>I first used primitive modelling in order to get a decent blockout, this would help me later with the high poly. After this I used a mixture of box modelling and edge extrusion 
													to help me achieve the shapes I wanted. I then finished the high poly model using sub-d modelling to get the smooth edges I needed. I will later take this into substance painter 
														in order to texture this accurately.</p>

												<h3>Temple Artefact</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I created and textured this 3D model of an artefact for an escape room me and my group are designing. This relic would be the final "prize" the players would recieve. 
												I mainly used edge extrusion as well as sub-d modelling in order to help me get the desired look. Texturing the model with gold gives it an expensive look as well as worn down 
													with the corrosion present.</p>

												<h3>Stylized Building</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This building was a second week University project where we instructed to create a building blockout which had to be based off of a referance image given to us. 
												After the initial blockout i decided to add more features to the building. 
											<br>I attempted to use a range of modifiers as well as payed attention to key details like the rope on the wooden fencing or the brick features on the walls. 
												These details are what really bring a model like this together.</p>
