												<h3> Freshers Jam 2022 </h3>
											</header>
											<p>This was my first ever game jam before any classes from University. <a href="https://michalsukenik.itch.io/after-school-detention"> "After School Detention" </a>was our idea as we had no restrictions. 
												I used Unity for this jam which was a fairly new engine to me. It was a challenge being the only programmer, however the game still had a win, fail and coin system implimented.</p>

												<h3>Kenney Jam 2023</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The theme for this jam was <a href="https://michalsukenik.itch.io/sea-scavenger">"Exploration." </a>We had a very small time window for unrelated reasons. However, even though we were very restricted I believe 
												we did a good job. I also attempted to create a save and load system however I didn't manage to get this done in time.</p>

												<h3> The GameDev.tv Game Jam 2023 </h3>
											</header>
											<p>For this jam the theme was <a href="https://michalsukenik.itch.io/coffee-break"> "Life In Two Dimensions." </a> Me and my partner came up with a reality/dream game. 
												The majority of our time was spent on 3D modelling as we were missing a team member, however I definitely enjoyed creating the movement script from scratch as well as the scene transitions. 
												If we were to redo this I would put much more time into some unique mechanics of the game.</p>
