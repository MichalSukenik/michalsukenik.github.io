								<h1>Visual Scripting</h1>

							<div class="content">
								<p>I have been using Unreal Engines visual scripting (blueprints) for about one year now and I have loved every minute of it. It brings me great satisfaction to 
									complete a project to the best of my ability and come up with my own way of doing certain mechanics in games. I especially love going above and beyond in projects where I can show of these skills.</p>

												<h3>Optimised Search Mechanic</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This mechanic and level was done as a part of a University project inside of a very basic framework given to us. I decided to impliment a search functionality. 
												The player can walk up to different objects and search them for resources.
											<br>By adding some aditional blueprints I managed to allow the creator to change the time taken to search and the resource output without having to go back into the blueprints.
												I had people play test my whole level including my professors and they all gave positive feedback.</p>

												<h3>Minecart</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This gameplay system was done in the same University Project framework. I created a minecart that is used to open up the next part of the level.
											<br>The minecart requires the player to have powered the rails as well as place the explosive inside before it takes off. I then used the explosion 
												to hide from the player when the door gets removed.</p>

											<p>This mechanic was done as a part of a University project inside of a framework given to us. I decided to impliment a search functionality. 
												The player can walk up to different objects and search them for resources.
											<br>I optimised this by having the search feature on a collision box instead of the indevidial items. By adding some aditional blueprints I managed
